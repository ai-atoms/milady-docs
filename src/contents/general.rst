What is MILADY?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Machine Learning DYnamics package ``MILADY 2.0`` is an open-souce code created by scientists for scientists.
Our goal is to improve the accuracy and predictive power of atomistic simulations.
The code uses Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and prioritises the methods with a reasonable computational cost.


``MILADY 2.0`` is distributed under Academic Software Licence (ASL).

**Main functionalities:**

- Development of ML force fields, suitable for Molecular Dynamics simulations.
- Development of surrogate regression models for prediction of materials properties, like vibrational entropy, HUMO-LUMO energies, etc.
- Representation of structures in the feature space of atomic descriptors
- Analysis, sparcification, and optimization of training databases

**Advantages of MILADY:**

- ``MILADY`` is designed for High Performance Computing (HPC). The code is well parallelized and has a good scalability. It uses MPI, PBLAS and ScaLapack.
- We provide a large choice of atomic :ref:`descriptors<sec:descriptors>`.
- We provide a possibility to perform various types of :ref:`regression<sec:models>`, including linear, quadratic, polynomial chaos, and :ref:`kernel<sec:kernel>` models.
- ``MILADY`` is open-source package and we are happy to include your contributins to the code.
