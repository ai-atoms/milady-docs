What is MILADY?
---------------

Machine Lerning DYnamics package ``MILADY`` is an open-souce code created by scientists for the scientists.
Our main goal is to improve the accuracy and predictive power of atomistic simulations.
``MILADY`` uses Machine Learning algorithms and prioritises the methods with a reasonable computational cost

The main functionalities of ``MILADY 2.0`` include:

- Development of ML force fields, suitable for Molecular Dynamics simulations
- Development of regression models (metamodels) for prediction of materials properties, like vibrational entropy, HUMO-LUMO energies, etc.
- Representation of structures in the feature space of atomic descriptors
- Analysis, sparcification, and optimization of training databases

We are open source we are interesteds if want to contribute to the developement, we provide a large choice in 
the :ref:`descriptors<sec:descriptors>`, many type of regression :ref:`models<sec:models>` from linear, quadratic, polynomial chaos to 
:ref:`kernel<sec:kernel>`. ``MILADY`` is designed for High Performance Computing (HPC) calculations with many level of parallelism using 
MPI, PBLAS and ScaLapack technologies.      

``MILADY`` is an open souce package, distributed under Academic Software Licence ("ASL").
